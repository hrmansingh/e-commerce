/** 

Note:- This project is still under development. I need more time as I started this project later and I can make the best out of it.
To setup the application:-

1- first clone the project by using "git clone <github_link>

2- Then open the terminal for the project and run "npm install" to install the necessary modules.

3- Then create a .env file and please add your credentials including "DATABASE_URL", "salt" for bcrypt, and "port" to declare the application running port.

4- then on terminal:- "npm run dev".

5- BINGO... application will start!

nodemon has been declared in project dependencies. So there's no need for you to install it explicitly!
